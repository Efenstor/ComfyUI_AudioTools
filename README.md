# Audio Processing Related ComfyUI Nodes

Audio is the bridge connecting text, video, and images. Videos without audio or text are bland. This project currently includes the following main nodes:
- Automatically add subtitles to videos
- Arbitrary time scale audio cropping
- Audio volume, speed, pitch, echo processing, etc.
- Remove silent parts from audio
- Recording
- Audio Watermark Embedding
- String show and editing. If editing is enabled, the workflow will pause execution. After editing, you can click "Continue Workflow" to continue execution

Examples:

1, Add subtitles to video:

2, Combine [ComfyUI_EraX-WoW-Turbo](https://github.com/billwuhao/ComfyUI_EraX-WoW-Turbo) for automatic speech recognition, and then add subtitles to the video:

3, Combine [ComfyUI_EraX-WoW-Turbo](https://github.com/billwuhao/ComfyUI_EraX-WoW-Turbo), [ComfyUI_gemmax](https://github.com/billwuhao/ComfyUI_gemmax), [ComfyUI_SparkTTS](https://github.com/billwuhao/ComfyUI_SparkTTS), [ComfyUI-LatentSyncWrapper](https://github.com/ShmuelRonen/ComfyUI-LatentSyncWrapper) for automatic speech recognition, automatic translation, automatic voice cloning, automatic lip sync, automatic subtitle addition to video (detailed example workflow [workflow-examples](./workflow-examples)):

6, Remove silent parts from audio and recording:

7, Audio Watermark Embedding (Disable watermark embedding; if a watermark exists, it will be automatically detected):

- To use this node, download all [SilentCipher](https://huggingface.co/Sony/SilentCipher/tree/main/44_1_khz/73999_iteration) models and place them in the `ComfyUI\models\TTS\SilentCipher\44_1_khz\73999_iteration` directory.

8, String show and editing. If editing is enabled, the workflow will pause execution. After editing, you can click "Continue Workflow" to continue execution:
