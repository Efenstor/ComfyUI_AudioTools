# Audio Processing Related ComfyUI Nodes

Audio is the bridge connecting text, video, and images. Videos without audio or text are bland. This project currently includes the following main nodes:
- Audio loading, customizable loading path, including subdirectories
  - Please rename the file `extra_help_file.yaml.example` to `extra_help_file.yaml` and remove the annotation `# `. Add a custom loading directory such as `audios_dir: D:\AIGC\ComfyUI-Data\audios_input`, Linux is `/`.
- Pause workflow anywhere
- Automatically add subtitles to videos
- Arbitrary time scale audio cropping
- Audio volume, speed, pitch, echo processing, etc.
- Remove silent parts from audio
- Recording
- Audio Watermark Embedding
- String show and editing. If editing is enabled, the workflow will pause execution. After editing, you can click "Continue Workflow" to continue execution

Examples:

- Audio loading:
